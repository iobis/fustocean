            <p><b>Celebrating 20 years of cooperation between the Government of Flanders and UNESCO</b></p>
            <p class="smaller">In 1998 the Government of Flanders signed a general cooperation agreement with UNESCO to achieve common global objectives.
                A year later Flanders approved the first 5-year agreement on the UNESCO/Flanders Fund-in-Trust for the support of UNESCO's activities in
                the field of Science (FUST). Since then 3 additional agreements have been signed.
                Under these agreements Flanders has provided support for projects by UNESCO's International Hydrological Programme (IHP), Man and the
                Biosphere Programme (MAB) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC).</p>
            <p class="smaller">The FUST Ocean event, including a guided exhibition and  four seminars, will present a remarkable opportunity to highlight
                achievements which were enabled through FUST, in the presence of guests from our partner countries and international organisations involved.
                The event will focus on the recent results and impacts of on-going key projects related to oceans and coastal areas.</p>

                    <h5>OceanTeacher Global Academy (OTGA)</h5>
                    <p>The OceanTeacher Global Academy (OTGA) Project aims at building equitable capacity related to ocean research, observations and services in all IOC Member States. The regional implementation strategy makes training programmes self-driven with great attention to local requirements, language and culture. OTGA is based on local ownership as the Regional Training Centres (RTCs) are supported by the host countries. In addition the OceanTeacher Global Academy validates the expertise available in developing regions and promotes their self-reliance in terms of specialized technical training and higher education related to ocean science, observation and data/information management.</p>

                    <h5>Caribbean Marine Atlas (CMA)</h5>
                    <p>The CMA is an online digital platform that supports the integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and ecosystem-based management for Large Marine Ecosystems in the Wider Caribbean region - mainly Caribbean and North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystems (the CLME+ Region). The Atlas is supporting the implementation of the CLME+ Strategic Action Programme. Special attention is paid to coastal hazards, climate change and biodiversity, as well as habitats, fisheries and pollution – the three main transboundary problems identified in the CLME+ Region. CMA brings together 25 countries, 7 of which are actively providing ICZM national information and data for regional indicators. CMA currently holds more than 800 GIS layers. The Atlas is addressed to professionals in charge of planning and development, ministries and national and regional authorities, decision and policy makers.</p>

                    <h5>Development of Information Products and Services for Ocean Assessments (DIPS-4-Ocean Assessments)</h5>
                    <p>DIPS develops information products and services based on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and the Harmful Algae Event Database (HAEDAT) with the aim to support major global assessments on the state of the marine environment, such as the UN World Ocean Assessment and those that are planned as part of the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and the IOC-UNESCO Global Harmful Algal Bloom Status Report.</p>

                    <h5>Southeast Pacific data and information network in support to integrated coastal area management (SPINCAM)</h5>
                    <p>SPINCAM was designed to establish an integrated coastal area management (ICAM) indicator framework at national and regional level in the countries of the Southeast Pacific region focusing on the state of the coastal and marine environment, including socio-economic conditions. SPINCAM is providing the right tools (data, information, indicators, atlases, decision-support tools) to apply the ecosystem-based approaches such as marine spatial planning in their national waters, while also providing a foundation for planning sustainable economic development (blue growth) through inter-institutional capacity-building. The project results will translate into concrete recommendations and strategies at the regional level in line with Agenda 2030.</p>

                    <h5>Biosphere Reserves as a Tool for Coastal and Island Management in the South- East Pacific Region (BRESEP)</h5>
                    <p>The objective of the BRESEP Project is to create and strengthen existing biosphere reserves, as a tool of sound innovative practices from a social, cultural and environmental viewpoint, in coastal zones and islands in the Pacific region in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru. This project brings added value to local socio-economic activities and in this way, improve livelihoods of the region's population.</p>
                    <p>BRESEP aims to build the capacities of the actors involved and create a collaborative network between the five participating countries to compare information, knowledge and experience on themes such as the loss of biodiversity, marine and coastal management, and improvement in the standard of living of the population through local, sustainable socio-economic activities.</p>
